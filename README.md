## Description

When creating a project on GitHub, it is essential to have a good README with all the information about your app, but this process can often be quite tedious. I have come up with a command line application to allow the user to create a quick and easy quality README, simply by answering questions when prompted. This will allow the user to spend more time working on finishing the project, and less time working on the README.

## Installation

In order to install this application, the user must clone the Good-README-Generator code, including the utils folder, index.js, and package.json. They then must install the npm inquirer on the command line. Once this has been completed, simply run “node index.js” on the command line and the program will begin.
